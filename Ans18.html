      Think about some of the different ways that people use computers. 
      In school, students use computers for tasks such as writing papers,
      searching for articles, sending email, and participating in online classes.
      At work, people use computers to analyze data, make pre- sentations, 
      conduct business transactions, communicate with customers and coworkers, 
      control machines in manufacturing facilities, and do many other things.
